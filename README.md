## 🏢 The Company: Yalo - Conversational Commerce

Yalo is an intelligent sales platform powered by Intelligent Agents.

Yalo helps companies sell more and build stronger customer relationships by automating personalized sales across WhatsApp, apps, voice, and more.

## 👨‍💻 The Role: Senior Technical Product Manager

On February 2022 I joined Yalo as a Sr. Technical Product Manager for their Core Services, after successfully completing a number of infrastructure related initiatives I transitioned to be the platform's commerce Product Manager.

As a Commerce Product Manager I managed the Store Front that drove sales through messaging applications, i.e. Whatsapp. The image below depicts a mobile web-based store front.
